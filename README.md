I'm __***BSOD#2528***__ and I am one of the most famous errors in all of Windows history. Okay enough joking. I am a new programmer and concentrate mostly on making Discord Bots. I do know Python ( relatively ) and currently learning CPP. Check out few of my projects I've done. All of them are dependent on __**[Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)**__
- [Beach - Bot](https://github.com/BSOD2528/Beach-Bot)
- [Geralt](https://github.com/BSOD2528/Geralt)

Check out my website by clicking [**here**](https://bsod2528.github.io/). It's a place where I document stuff for no reason lol. Kudos to [@kitian616](https://github.com/kitian616) for the amazing Jekyll Theme -- [TeXT](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme)
